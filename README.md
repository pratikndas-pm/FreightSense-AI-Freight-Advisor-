## 🧭 1. Product Overview

FreightSense is a **smart AI Freight Advisor** that helps freight forwarders, brokers, and shippers make faster, data-driven decisions — from quoting to tracking.

It combines **AI models**, **live logistics data**, and **conversational intelligence** to provide predictive insights on rates, ETAs, routes, and leads — all in one unified workspace.

---

## 💡 2. The Problem

Freight operations today are **slow, fragmented, and reactive**.  
Teams use multiple systems, emails, and spreadsheets to perform simple tasks like:
- Finding the best freight rate  
- Comparing transit times  
- Tracking delayed containers  
- Identifying promising leads  

This fragmentation leads to **delayed responses**, **inconsistent pricing**, and **poor customer experience**.

---

## 🚀 3. The Solution

FreightSense acts as a **digital co-pilot** for freight teams.  
It lets users ask questions in plain English and instantly get:
- Predictive rate recommendations  
- Optimized routes with CO₂ insights  
- Live shipment tracking with AI-based ETA  
- Ranked customer leads by win probability  

By connecting CRMs, TMSs, and APIs, FreightSense turns raw logistics data into actionable intelligence.
